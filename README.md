ExportLayers_DefaultName

ExportLayers_SetNewName

Export the psd layers to the specified folder in order from bottom to top.

You can use the layer name as the default name, or set a new file name yourself, and automatically add a digital serial number suffix to the file name. The default resolution is 300dpi.

GenerateSpriteSheet_FromPNG

Select png files, automatically calculate the size of the sprite, use the linked object method to insert png into the sprite, and open it as a psd file, which needs to be saved manually.

It is recommended to save the psd file, so that when you replace the png file with the same name in the future, you can automatically replace the corresponding frame in the sprite psd.
